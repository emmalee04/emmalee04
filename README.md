### Hi! I'm Emma ðŸ‘‹

## âœ¨ About me

Hello! My name is Emma and I major CS @ University of Washington (+Math/Business minor)!


Why CS? Because you can create basically anything you want! I love building all kinds of things, and am especially interested full-stack and web/mobile development, writing elegant and scalable code. I enjoy working on personal projects to make my ideas come alive and conducting research on areas I am interested in. Outside of coding, I love exploring new things and living life to the fullest; who knows what opportunities and events may come along the way? In my free time, I love snowboarding, music, design, and food ventures. 

## ðŸª„ Experiences

- Incoming SDE @ Amazon
- Undergrad TA for FIN205 & CSE190B
- Researcher for UW Mobile Intelligence Lab @ Target Speech Hearing
- Researcher for UW SEAL @ Arduino Covid Sensors
